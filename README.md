Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Dilip Gawade final year BSc. IT student (2021-2024) from Mumbai University. After working as call center employee and Back office assistant when I decided to switch into IT, it was tough to decide which tech stack I should go with. I tried to gave a chance to my creative side and frontend development excited me. Plus React.js being the hot topic in frontend I decided to go with it.

Currently working on a BlackJack game using React.js. I came to know about this game when I was watching a tutorial for JavaScript on freecodecamp YouTube channel.

If you are hiring for Junior roles or even if you have some internship please feel free to connect with me.

Thanks and regards,

Dilip
